Docker Compose is used to create a full installation of fAIr (with redis, worker, postgis database, api and frontend), all in one Docker container. This setup is suitable for development. For production it is not recommended. ***TODO*** What is production? Is it the version that executes on the web site?

## Installation of fAIr using Docker

In the following, four directories are created: ```fair, ramp-code, ramp``` and ```training```, for the fAIr code, the model code, the model variables, and temporary data used during fine-tunining training of the (RAMP) model. It is a good idea to create these directories in the same, new, directory, created for this installation of fAIr and its companions.

1. Check your graphics card

    It is highly recommended to use a graphics card to run fAIr. It might not work with CPU only. The graphics card is orders of magnitude more powerful then the CPU for the heavy computations involved in model training. 

    For the local fAIr installation to work, the necessary drivers for the graphics card need to be installed. By the following command you can see your graphics card and the graphics driver details and the NVIDIA container toolkit that is installed. If it returns, then you have set up your drivers correctly. If not, then either you don't have a graphics card or the drivers are not set up correctly. There is more information on the [NVIDIA site](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html and [another NVIDIA page]https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).

    ```
    nvidia-smi
    ```

    You need to see your graphics card details here. If you do, then fAIr is able to use your graphics card for model training.

We have tested fAIr on several different NVIDIA cards. It may be difficult to get it to work on graphics cards from other brands.

2. Install Docker Compose

    If Docker is not installed, install it from the [Docker site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

To check whether Docker is installed, type 

    ```
    docker compose version
    ```

3. Clone the repository for fAIr.

    In a Windows Command Prompt window, type 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/hotosm/fAIr.git
    ```

    This creates directory ```./fAIr```.

4. Clone the Base Model and create environment variable RAMP_HOME

    - Clone the RAMP code. 

        ```
        git clone https://github.com/kshitijrajsharma/ramp-code-fAIr.git 
        ```

    This creates directory ```./ramp-code-fAIr```.

    - Create environment variable RAMP_HOME 

        Set RAMP_HOME to be the file path to the directory ```ramp-code-fAIr```. 

        ```
        set RAMP_HOME=C:\Users\kshitij\fAIr_install\ramp-code-fAIr
        ```

    - Download pre-trained variable values for the RAMP model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQsY61S_rGfJ_f6kLQq4ouYE2l3iRe1k/view). 

        If that doesn't work, you can alternatively use the variables in the original RAMP model, [RAMP Baseline](https://github.com/radiantearth/model_ramp_baseline/tree/main/data/input/checkpoint.tf)

    - Create a new folder called ```ramp-variables```.

        ```
        mkdir ramp-variables
        ```

    - Unzip the downloaded base model variables in subdirectory ```ramp-variables```.

        Move the compressed file to directory ```ramp-variables```. Right-click on it in File Explorer and choose "Extract All...". 

    - Create environment variable TRAINING_WORKSPACE

        Training workspace is the directory where fAIr will store its training files, including permanent storage of training results.

        ```
        mkdir trainings
        set TRAINING_WORKSPACE=C:\Users\kshitij\fAIr_install\trainings
        ```

5. Register your Local setup to OSM ***TODO*** Settings in OSM? "your Local setup" = my local fAIr installation?

    - Go to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), Log in (If needed: Create an account first.).
    - Click on your Profile and Hit ```My Settings```
    - Navigate to ```Oauth2 Applications```
    - Register a new application 
    - Check permissions for ```Read user preferences``` and set Redirect URI to be ```http://127.0.0.1:3000/authenticate/```. Give it the name  ```fAIr Dev Local```
    - You will get ```OSM_CLIENT_ID``` and ```OSM_CLIENT_SECRET```. Copy them. 

6. Create environment files
 
    - Create a file ```.env``` in directory backend with a copy of the content in [docker_sample_env](../backend/docker_sample_env).
 
        ```
        cd backend
        copy docker_sample_env .env
        ```

    - Fill in the details of ```OSM_CLIENT_ID``` and ```OSM_CLIENT_SECRET``` in the .env file and generate a unique key and paste it to ```OSM_SECRET_KEY``` (It can be any value in a setup for development).

    - Change EXPORT_TOOL_API_URL to be https://api-prod.raw-data.hotosm.org/v1 
    
        Leave the other items as they are, unless you have a specific, well-defined need.

    
7. Build and Run containers 

    In directory fAIr, run the following commands:

    ```
    docker compose build
    docker compose up
    ```

8. Run Migrations

    ***TODO*** What does "migration" mean in this context?

    Grab API container and Open Bash: In another Command Prompt window, go to directory fAIr and execute: 

    ```
    docker exec -it api bash
    ```

    It will say "TensorFlow" with big fancy letters. On the new prompt line, run the following commands, one at a time:

        python manage.py makemigrations
        python manage.py makemigrations login
        python manage.py makemigrations core
        python manage.py migrate

9. Play 

    In the Command Prompt window where Docker is up, stop it (^C) and restart the containers: 

    ```
    docker compose restart
    ```

    Backend will be available on 8000, and Flower on 5500. 
    You can now go to the [frontend setup page](Docker-frontend-setup.md) to setup the frontend.



Extra. Do you want to run your local tiles? 

You can use [TiTiler](https://github.com/developmentseed/titiler), [gdals2tiles](https://gdal.org/programs/gdal2tiles.html) or nginx to run your own TMS server and add the following to docker compose in order to access your localhost through docker containers. Add this to API and Worker. Also update the .env variable accordingly 

```
network_mode: "host"
```

Example docker compose : 

```yaml
backend-api:
    build:
    context: ./backend
    dockerfile: Dockerfile_CPU
    container_name: api
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

    ports:
    - 8000:8000
    volumes:
    - ./backend:/app
    - ${RAMP_HOME}:/RAMP_HOME
    - ${TRAINING_WORKSPACE}:/TRAINING_WORKSPACE
    depends_on:
    - redis
    - postgres
    network_mode: "host"

backend-worker:
    build:
    context: ./backend
    dockerfile: Dockerfile_CPU
    container_name: worker
    command: celery -A aiproject worker --loglevel=INFO --concurrency=1

    volumes:
    - ./backend:/app
    - ${RAMP_HOME}:/RAMP_HOME
    - ${TRAINING_WORKSPACE}:/TRAINING_WORKSPACE
    depends_on:
    - backend-api
    - redis
    - postgres
    network_mode: "host"
```

Example `.env` after this host change : 

```
DATABASE_URL=postgis://postgres:admin@localhost:5434/ai
CELERY_BROKER_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND="redis://localhost:6379/0"
```
